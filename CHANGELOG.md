# Changelog

All notable changes to FloodMind are documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Added SDK-first folder workspace defaults: `Agent` now binds a folder-first workspace from the launch cwd when no explicit workspace is provided.
- Added `.floodmind/` managed layout for sessions, artifacts, tmp files, scripts, and sandboxes under the active workspace.
- Added SDK purity tests covering top-level import boundaries and core dependency metadata.
- Added neutral runtime adapter modules with legacy Flask/SSE shim modules kept as compatibility aliases.

### Changed

- Changed default dependency surface to SDK/core-only; Web/TUI dependencies live behind optional extras.
- Changed CLI Web/TUI commands to legacy notice-only behavior instead of starting old UI stacks.
- Changed file tools and Bash workspace handling to route path/cwd/workdir resolution through runtime path and permission services.
- Changed artifact watching to focus on the workspace artifact directory instead of treating the workspace root as generated output.

### Fixed

- Fixed recursive checkpoint file snapshots by making checkpoints state-only.
- Removed the file snapshot parameter from `CheckpointService.save()`; checkpoints now persist only `state.json` and `manifest.json`.
- Fixed legacy Web adapter tests so they skip in SDK/core-only environments without Flask.

### Verification

- Full core-only test suite: `532 passed, 1 skipped`.
- The single skipped test is legacy Web adapter compatibility that requires optional `floodmind[web]` / Flask extra.
